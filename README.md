## 📊 Results

Accuracy: 95%
Mean Average Precision (MAP): 0.5 - 0.7
Inference Time Reduction: 30%
The model performs exceptionally well across diverse datasets, providing robust and consistent detection even in challenging scenarios like poor lighting, different weather conditions, and various camera angles.
## 🚀 How It Works

Preprocessing: The input images are preprocessed for consistent results, including resizing and normalization.
Detection: Using the YOLO algorithm, the model identifies license plates within the image.
Post-processing: Detected license plates are extracted and highlighted, enabling further tasks like recognition.
## 📝 Usage

Detect License Plate from an Image
Upload an image containing a license plate.
The system will detect and highlight the license plate(s) in real-time.
Results will be displayed on the same page, along with inference time.
## 💡 Future Work

Integration with OCR: Adding Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for complete license plate recognition.
Support for Video Processing: Extend the system to handle video streams for continuous monitoring.
Enhanced Scalability: Further reduce inference time and improve model accuracy.
